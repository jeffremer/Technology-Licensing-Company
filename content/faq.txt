Q: What does Patent <a href="patent.html">#5,734,862</a> cover?<br />
A: The best thing to do is review the patent itself, available for download from this website. However, basically, <a href="patent.html">862</a> covers interactive seamless branching of the type used in todays CDROM and DVD productions.  For example, a scene change from a first scene to a second scene made in response to a user selection during playback of the first scene is likely to fall within the domain of <a href="patent.html">862</a>.
