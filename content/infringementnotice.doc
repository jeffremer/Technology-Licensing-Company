TLC is the exclusive licensor of US Patent # 5,734,862. Generally, ‘862 relates to seamless branching on DVDs, thus allowing for reduced seek time when jumping from one scene or data set to another. Virtually anyone conforming to the DVD Video Specification should acquire a license to ‘862. In order to determine if your company’s products require a license, feel free to request a trial DVD. This is a consumer music video DVD containing seamless branching demonstrations and, if playable in a DVD player, is a good indication that the player uses the patented technology. 

The following terms cover companies that manufacture and/or sell products that play DVDs under their own brands or the brands of their affiliates. They do not cover hardware companies that manufacture OEM DVD drives and components for resale to third parties for use in third party products. These manufacturers are covered by our OEM agreement. These terms do not cover software manufacturers, distributors and content creators. For more information regarding OEM licenses and other licenses contact us directly. If your company engages in both branded sales and OEM sales, you will need to acquire both licenses.

The license is a fully paid up, perpetual license; there is no obligation to pay or account to TLC with respect to royalties. To determine your license fee, find your company revenue level and decide if you wish to obtain a license for one product, more than one product and wish to include affiliates. If you include affiliates your license will automatically cover multiple products.
